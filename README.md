Project Title: Student Self-Service Book Issuing System
1. Introduction
Purpose:
To develop a system that allows students to issue and return books without teacher intervention, thereby saving time and reducing manual entry errors.
Scope:
This project will automate the book issuing and returning process in a school library.
2. Objectives
To create a user-friendly interface for students to issue and return books.
To maintain an updated database of issued and returned books.
To generate reports on book circulation.
To notify students about due dates and overdue books.
To impose fines on late submissions and restrict new book issuances until previous books are returned and fines are paid.
3. System Overview
Modules:
User Authentication
Book Search and Issuance
Book Return
Fine Calculation and Payment
Notification System
Administrative Interface
Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter
Backend: Python, Java
Database: MySQL
Architecture:
A three-tier architecture with the frontend, backend, and database layers.
4. Functional Requirements
User Authentication

Students must log in using their student ID and password.
Admins (teachers) must have a separate login for managing the system.
Book Search and Issuance

Students can search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
Students can issue a book if it is available.
The system should update the book’s status in the database.
Students cannot issue a new book until the previous one is returned along with any applicable fines.
Book Return

Students can log in to return a book.
The system should update the book’s status in the database.
Fine Calculation and Payment

The system calculates fines for late book returns based on predefined rules.
Students must pay the fine before they can issue a new book.
Notification System

The system should send notifications for due dates, overdue books, and pending fines via email or SMS.
Administrative Interface

Admins can add, update, or delete book records.
Admins can view reports on book circulation and fines.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The system should handle multiple users simultaneously without performance degradation.
Reliability: The system should be reliable and recover quickly from failures.
Security: Ensure data security with encryption and secure authentication mechanisms.
Usability: The system should be easy to use for students and admins.
6. Database Design
Tables:
Students (student_id, name, email, password)
Books (book_id, title, author, ISBN, status)
Issued_Books (issue_id, student_id, book_id, issue_date, due_date, return_date, fine)
Admins (admin_id, name, email, password)
Fines (fine_id, student_id, issue_id, amount, paid_status)
7. System Design
Use Case Diagrams:
Illustrate interactions between students, admins, and the system.
Sequence Diagrams:
Show the sequence of operations for book issuance, return, and fine payment.
ER Diagram:
Depict the relationships between the database tables.
8. Implementation Plan
Phase 1:
Design the database schema.
Develop the user authentication module.
Phase 2:
Implement the book search and issuance module.
Develop the book return module.
Phase 3:
Implement the fine calculation and payment module.
Create the notification system.
Develop the administrative interface.
Phase 4:
Test the system thoroughly.
Deploy the system.
9. Testing Plan
Unit Testing: Test individual modules.
Integration Testing: Ensure modules work together.
System Testing: Test the complete system.
User Acceptance Testing: Get feedback from students and admins.
10. Maintenance Plan
Regular updates for security and functionality.
User feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.
Backup and recovery plan for the database.
11. Conclusion
This system aims to streamline the book issuing process, making it more efficient and less reliant on manual intervention, thereby saving time for both students and teachers. The addition of fine management ensures timely book returns and maintains the integrity of the library system.
